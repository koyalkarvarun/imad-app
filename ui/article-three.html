    <h1> Node JS History</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment<br>
        for executing JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used<br>
        primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript<br>
        are embedded in a webpage's HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine <br>
        in the user's web browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side <br>
        scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content<br>
        before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js has<br>
        become one of the foundational elements of the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,<br>
        [5] allowing web application development to unify around a single programming<br>
        language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.
