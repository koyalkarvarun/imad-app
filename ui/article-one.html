        Grammer
      </h1>
      <p class="pragraph">In linguistics, grammar (from Greek: γραμματική)<br> 
        is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses,<br>
        phrases, and words in any given natural language. The term refers also<br>
        to the study of such rules, and this field includes phonology, morphology,<br>
        and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics.
